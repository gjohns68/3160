Introduction (Team, Project Description):
We are team 4 and are enhancing an existing database for Spring 2021, ITCS 3160 taught by Dr. Thompson.
To enhance this database, we will be implementing a rating system for food delivery drivers as well as restaurants.
We will be creating a method to rate drivers as well as the restaurants.
It will be based on data from test records created using generatedata.com.
